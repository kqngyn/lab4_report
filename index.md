# Lab Report 4
## Khoi Nguyen
For the lab report this week, I will be performing the tasks listed below. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), I will be detailing exactly which keys I pressed to get to that step. Furthermore, explaining the commands I ran and what the effect of those keypresses were. <br>
**NOTE**: The commands and steps I took will mostly be focused on steps that are starting after the timer as explained above. This includes step 4 to 9. <br>
1. **Setup** Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. **Setup** Fork the repository
3. **The real deal** Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6

5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test

8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
